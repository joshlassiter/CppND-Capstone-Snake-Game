# CPPND: Capstone Snake Game Example

This is a starter repo for the Capstone project in the [Udacity C++ Nanodegree Program](https://www.udacity.com/course/c-plus-plus-nanodegree--nd213). The code for this repo was inspired by [this](https://codereview.stackexchange.com/questions/212296/snake-game-in-c-with-sdl) excellent StackOverflow post and set of responses.

The Capstone Project gives you a chance to integrate what you've learned throughout this program. This project will become an important part of your portfolio to share with current and future colleagues and employers.

In this project, you can build your own C++ application or extend this Snake game, following the principles you have learned throughout this Nanodegree Program. This project will demonstrate that you can independently create applications using a wide range of C++ features.

## Dependencies for Running Locally
* cmake >= 3.7
  * All OSes: [click here for installation instructions](https://cmake.org/install/)
* make >= 4.1 (Linux, Mac), 3.81 (Windows)
  * Linux: make is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: [install Xcode command line tools to get make](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: [Click here for installation instructions](http://gnuwin32.sourceforge.net/packages/make.htm)
* SDL2 >= 2.0
  * All installation instructions can be found [here](https://wiki.libsdl.org/Installation)
  >Note that for Linux, an `apt` or `apt-get` installation is preferred to building from source. 
* gcc/g++ >= 5.4
  * Linux: gcc / g++ is installed by default on most Linux distros
  * Mac: same deal as make - [install Xcode command line tools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/features/)
  * Windows: recommend using [MinGW](http://www.mingw.org/)

## Basic Build Instructions

1. Clone this repo.
2. Make a build directory in the top level directory: `mkdir build && cd build`
3. Compile: `cmake .. && make`
4. Run it: `./SnakeGame`.

## Rubric Points
1. Object Oriented Programming - The project code is organized into classes with class attributes to hold the data, and class methods to perform tasks.


2. loops,Functions, i/o - The project accepts input from a user as part of the necessary operation of the program.

3. loops,Functions, i/o - The project reads data from an external file or writes data to a file as part of the necessary operation of the program.

4. Object Oriented Programming - All class member functions document their effects, either through function names, comments, or formal documentation. Member functions do not change program state in undocumented ways.

5. Object Oriented Programming - All class data members are explicitly specified as public, protected, or private.

## Additional Features
1. Added a food class to allow the food to have its own data member type(ie. Bonus or regular).
2. Added a feature that allows user to input their name before the game starts
3. Store scores to a text document after a user plays the game
4. Added the opportunity for the user to gain extra points if they hit the "bonus" food.  The bonus food is identified by the color green. 
5. Allowed two food options to be displayed at the same time 
6. Defined a data type "foodType"
